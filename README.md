# :pencil2: Last-pencil

You're welcome to play one of the simplest and yet entertaining games!

It usually takes two to tango (to play, of course ðŸ˜„).

And this program meets this rule. Except that this time you have to beat AI to prevail! ðŸ¤–

## How to play?

To start the duel, download and run the 'Last_pencil.py' file.

Select the number of pencils at the start and choose who will be the first player.

The AI's name Jack, and you're going to be John.

You'll take turns removing pencils from the table, but no more than 3 at a time.

The goal is leave the opponent (in your case the AI) no choice but to be the last to remove the remaining pencils.

So let the battle begin!
